Shortcut assignments not working.

When user clicks twice on equipment send equip packet.

NEEDS TESTING - User Server is not releasing users when dropping the connection in select Player window.

Have GameServer update the player counts to the UserServer.

FIXED - swapping equipment items to different boxes deletes item.

FIXED - When equipping/unequipping leather item, the sprite changes too.
