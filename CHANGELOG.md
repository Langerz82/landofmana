### 20/12/2024
This project now uses a seperate User Server and Game Server thats in the experimental folder. Completed Quests may have reset for players but other than that everything should work ok. If there are issues please let me know, cheers.

### 25/11/2024
I am still working on this code. If you like this game give the project a Star/Like. Haha!!

### 18/07/2024 - NOTICE
I have provided the source to the Client and Server, see the js directory in client and server.

### 24/04/2024 - NOTICE
I will be no longer working on this project. I've come to the realisation that in order for this project to grow, I need more content and variety. Coding a game like this in a browser has several technical challenges and resource costs which I simply cannot afford being a solo developer. Compiled Client and Server code will be kept up here. The Live Server will run for as long as I can keep it up for without running extra costs but any new releases will most likely not occur.

### 06/12/2023
The version uploaded to this repository is v87, which is a new test version. The test server is still at the previous version 86. I will update the Game Server to the same version when I have tested the version more. Thanks.

### 22/11/2023
Unfortunately there were major errors when saving Players. For this reason I had to wipe the Server data. Old accounts will need to be re-created and Players will have to start from new again. My sincere apologies however this was a necessary step as the data save process corrupted accounts and did not let the users in again once created. Thanks for understanding.

Items and Quests may have been wiped for current accounts. This was needed as they save in a new format. Having it done now will make the saving backend faster, thanks for your understanding.
